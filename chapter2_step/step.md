# What this markdown all about?

This markdown document is a **practical, end-to-end playbook** for conducting a modern literature review—especially when your topic sits at the intersection of a technical domain (your “asset” or application area) and **Explainable AI (XAI)**. Its purpose is not just to tell you _where to search_, but to show you **how to search systematically**, how to generate strong search queries quickly, how to collect evidence efficiently, and how to turn what you find into **defensible research gaps and research objectives**.

At a first glance, this markdown is designed to feel like a **guided workflow** rather than a random set of notes. It starts from the moment you have a research title and you’re unsure what keywords to use. Instead of guessing search terms manually, it proposes using a **large language model (LLM)** as a structured assistant: you provide your exact title and domain context, and the LLM returns a carefully organized keyword bank plus **ready-to-paste advanced search strings** for major academic databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and more). This helps you move from vague ideas (“I need papers about XAI in my domain”) to precise, reproducible queries (“these exact boolean strings retrieve the most relevant literature”).

From there, the markdown transitions into the real-world research task: **indexing scientific databases** and extracting **abstract details**. This matters because a literature review is built on evidence—titles, abstracts, authors, venues, years, keywords, and DOIs—not just opinions. The document provides a straightforward way to take the keywords generated in Step 1 and apply them in reputable search systems, then collect abstracts in a consistent format so you can compare papers, screen relevance, and build a clean dataset for synthesis.

Finally, the markdown goes beyond “finding papers” and addresses what many students struggle with most: **how to find a research gap that is meaningful and defendable**. The included Mermaid flowchart is not decoration—it acts like a decision map and a “gap funnel.” It forces you to check the most common weak points in research (datasets, features, label quality, validation, generalization, faithfulness of explanations, physics/mechanism consistency, and human usefulness). In other words, it turns your literature review into a structured investigation: as you pass through each gate, you naturally create a **Gap Ledger**—a clear record of what the field has done, what it has not done well, and exactly where your thesis can contribute.

In short, this markdown exists to give the reader a strong first impression: **this is not just a set of instructions—this is a repeatable research workflow**. It helps you go from _topic → keywords → database search → abstract collection → synthesis → gap discovery → research objectives_. If someone reads only the beginning, they should immediately understand that the document is meant to save time, increase rigor, and make the literature review process more systematic, transparent, and thesis-ready.

# STEP 1: Use LLM to generate key word

The first step is to use this **general “master prompt” ** and feed it to an agent to generate ** keyword lists + ready-to-use advanced search strings** (Google Scholar / Scopus / WoS / IEEE Xplore).

---

## General Prompt for Literature-Review Search Keywords + Advanced Search Strings (XAI)

**ROLE**
You are a systematic literature search assistant for a PhD literature review. The research topic is:

**TITLE:** `<PASTE YOUR EXACT TITLE HERE>`
**DOMAIN/ASSET (optional):** `<e.g., power transformer, PV forecasting, medical imaging>`
**TASK TYPE:** literature review search strategy for **Explainable AI (XAI)** applied to this domain, including links to **physics/process/causal explanations** where relevant.

**OBJECTIVE**
Generate comprehensive **keywords** and **advanced search queries** that I can directly copy into **Google Scholar**, **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, **IEEE Xplore**, and **ScienceDirect** advanced search. The goal is to retrieve papers about:

1. ML/DL models used in this domain
2. XAI methods used to explain predictions
3. Domain-meaningful explanations (physics/process causes, fault mechanisms, etc.)
4. Datasets, features, evaluation metrics, and gaps

---

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (do not change)

Produce output with these sections exactly:

### A) Core Concepts → Keyword Bank

Create keyword banks (each as bullet lists) for:

1. **Domain synonyms & asset terms** (include abbreviations, alternate spellings)
2. **Task synonyms** (classification / forecasting / diagnosis / detection / RUL / anomaly, etc.)
3. **Data & sensing terms** (signals, sensors, modalities, sampling, operating conditions)
4. **Feature terms** (handcrafted features + learned representations)
5. **Model terms** (baseline ML + DL architectures commonly used)
6. **XAI terms** (global/local, post-hoc/intrinsic, model-specific/model-agnostic)
7. **Physics/process/causality terms** (mechanism, interpretable physics, causal, failure modes, governing processes)
8. **Evaluation terms** (faithfulness, stability, robustness, human evaluation, sanity checks, fidelity)
9. **Dataset & benchmark terms** (public dataset names if known; otherwise “open dataset”, “benchmark”, “field data”, “SCADA”, etc.)

Each bank must include:

- **primary terms**
- **synonyms**
- **acronyms**
- **common variants** (e.g., “explainable AI” AND “explainability” AND “interpretability”)

---

### B) “Query Builder Blocks” (copy-paste chunks)

Provide reusable OR-blocks, each on one line, in this style:

- **DOMAIN_BLOCK:** `(term1 OR term2 OR "exact phrase" OR acronym)`
- **TASK_BLOCK:** `(…)`
- **DATA_BLOCK:** `(…)`
- **MODEL_BLOCK:** `(…)`
- **XAI_BLOCK:** `(…)`
- **PHYSICS_BLOCK:** `(…)`
- **EVAL_BLOCK:** `(…)`

Keep each block under ~25 terms (make multiple blocks if needed).

---

### C) Ready-to-Paste Advanced Search Strings

Generate **at least 12 complete queries**, grouped by intent. Each query must be directly pasteable.

**C1. Broad coverage (3 queries)**
**C2. XAI + domain (3 queries)**
**C3. XAI + physics/process (2 queries)**
**C4. Dataset + benchmarking (2 queries)**
**C5. Evaluation of explanations (2 queries)**

Rules:

- Use **AND / OR / parentheses / quotes** correctly.
- Provide both **short** (Google Scholar-friendly) and **strict** (Scopus/WoS-friendly) versions if they differ.
- Include at least **2 “negative filter”** variants using NOT (e.g., excluding unrelated domains).

---

### D) Database-Specific Versions

Create versions formatted for:

1. **Google Scholar** (shorter, fewer parentheses if needed)
2. **Scopus Advanced Search** (TITLE-ABS-KEY())
3. **Web of Science** (TS=)
4. **IEEE Xplore** ((""All Metadata":...") style OR simple boolean if unsure)

If exact syntax is uncertain, still output a best-effort query that works in most advanced searches.

---

### E) Search Expansion Plan (systematic)

Give a checklist to expand the search:

- “seed papers → snowballing (forward/backward)”
- “swap in synonyms from keyword banks”
- “add/remove XAI methods”
- “add dataset names once found”
- “add failure mode / mechanism terms once found”
- “time window suggestions” (e.g., 2015–present for XAI heavy; 2020–present for modern SHAP/IG usage)

---

### F) Final Deliverable

End with a compact **Top 10 “best first” queries** list (most likely to work well immediately).

---

### CONSTRAINTS

- Do **not** summarize papers.
- Do **not** invent dataset names; if unsure, label as **[unknown dataset]** and give _search terms to discover datasets_.
- Must include **XAI taxonomy coverage**: SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM, saliency, permutation importance, PDP/ICE, counterfactuals, concept-based (TCAV), surrogate models, rule extraction, attention-as-explanation (with caution), causal explainability.
- Must include **gap-hunting angles**: missing features, missing operating conditions, lack of faithfulness checks, lack of physics linkage, poor generalization, dataset bias, concept drift.

# STEP 2: Index Scientific database

## What “Index Scientific Database” means

An **indexed scientific database** is a platform that stores and organizes scholarly research articles so researchers can search them easily.

Two common examples are:

- Google Scholar — free academic search engine that indexes papers, theses, books, and conference articles.
- Scopus — a large subscription-based research database used for academic analysis and citation tracking.

These databases help you:

- Find scientific papers quickly
- Check article credibility
- Access abstracts and citation info
- Build literature reviews

---

## Paste the keyword you obtain from step 1, into the search links

You start with a **keyword** related to your topic.

This flow chart act lie **gap-funnel + decision ledger**, it can directly help you **surface defensible gaps** and turn them into **measurable research objectives**.

# STEP 5: How the literature review helps to finds gaps

The flowchart forces you to answer a set of “gap-revealing” questions at key gates. Each gate corresponds to a common gap category:

1. **Literature coverage gates**
   - _Has ML been studied? Has XAI been studied?_
     **Gap types:** “no XAI-in-domain”, “weak/invalid XAI evaluation”, “no cross-dataset evidence”.

2. **Dataset inventory gate (# independent datasets)**
   - 0 / 1 / 2+ datasets
     **Gap types:** “no open benchmark”, “single-dataset overfitting risk”, “no transfer/generalization analysis”.

3. **Feature audit gate (considered vs missing features)**
   - _Are missing features critical to physics/mechanism?_
     **Gap types:** “mechanism-relevant variables absent”, “no regime tags”, “no contextual metadata”.

4. **Label reliability gate**
   - _Labels noisy / ambiguous / inconsistent mapping?_
     **Gap types:** “weak supervision needed”, “no label governance”, “mixed-fault ambiguity unresolved”.

5. **Evaluation gates**
   - _Generalization/robustness tested? uncertainty needed?_
     **Gap types:** “no stress testing”, “no uncertainty calibration”, “no regime-based error analysis”.

6. **XAI validation gates**
   - **Faithfulness**: do explanations actually reflect model behavior?
   - **Physics consistency**: do explanations align with known mechanisms?
     **Gap types:** “XAI used but not validated”, “explanations not physics-defensible”, “unstable explanations”.

7. **Human usefulness gate**
   - _Do explanations help an expert make decisions?_
     **Gap types:** “no user-centered evaluation”, “explanations not actionable”.
8. **can be more reason, you can ask LLM, or do ur own research** this is not an exhaustive list

Once you fill these gates using your domain’s evidence, you will naturally accumulate a **Gap Ledger** (the flowchart even has that node).

---

### How it generates research objectives

Each gap can be converted into an objective using a consistent template:

**Gap → Objective (RO) formula**

- “Because **[what is missing]**, we will **[what we will build/test]**, and evaluate it by **[measurable criteria]**.”

Below are objective “patterns” that map cleanly from flowchart gates:

#### Objective pattern A — Dataset gap

- **Gap:** Only one dataset / no public benchmark / missing metadata
- **RO:** Create/curate a dataset or protocol + benchmarking suite
- **Deliverables:** dataset spec, dataset card, splits, reproducible pipeline, baseline models

#### Objective pattern B — Feature/physics gap

- **Gap:** Mechanism-critical features missing (or not derived)
- **RO:** Engineer physics-informed features (or add sensors/metadata) and quantify improvements
- **Deliverables:** feature set + ablation + regime analysis + explanation plausibility

#### Objective pattern C — Model generalization gap

- **Gap:** No cross-site/season/dataset generalization
- **RO:** Build models designed for transfer/robustness and test under shift
- **Deliverables:** cross-dataset experiments, robustness benchmarks, failure modes

#### Objective pattern D — XAI validation gap

- **Gap:** XAI used without faithfulness/stability/physics tests
- **RO:** Propose an explanation validation framework (faithfulness + stability + physics checks)
- **Deliverables:** metrics + tests + comparisons across XAI methods

#### Objective pattern E — Physics-grounded XAI gap (your “signature”)

- **Gap:** Explanations not linked to physical mechanisms
- **RO:** Develop regime-aware, physics-consistent explanations (constraints, hybrid models, residual-to-physics baseline)
- **Deliverables:** physics-consistency tests, constraint results, case studies

#### Objective pattern F — Human usefulness gap

- **Gap:** Explanations not actionable for operators/engineers
- **RO:** Build explanation formats aligned to decisions and run an expert study
- **Deliverables:** UI/reporting format + expert evaluation protocol

---

### A practical way to use it (so you _actually_ get objectives)

Make a simple table from the flowchart outputs:

| Flowchart gate | Evidence you find | Gap statement | Objective | How you’ll measure success |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |

You can fill this in as you read papers and inspect datasets. After 10–20 papers, gaps usually become obvious.

---

### Example (generic, physics-grounded XAI theme)

If your literature review reveals:

- It can be no XAI exist, so, you can play with SHAP plots" and do validation, or
- XAI exists but mostly “SHAP plots” with no validation,
- datasets lack regime labels,
- explanations change wildly across resampling,

Then a defensible gap-objective pair is:

- **Gap:** “Existing XAI in the domain is rarely validated for faithfulness/stability and lacks physics-consistency checks, making explanations unreliable for engineering decisions.”
- **RO:** “Develop and evaluate a physics-grounded XAI validation pipeline that tests faithfulness, stability, and physics consistency across regimes and datasets.”
