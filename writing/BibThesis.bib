  abstract                = {Introduction to EEG- and Speech-Based Emotion Recognition Methods examines the background, methods, and utility of using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to detect and recognize different emotions. By incorporating these methods in brain-computer interface (BCI), we can achieve more natural, efficient communication between humans and computers. This book discusses how emotional states can be recognized in EEG images, and how this is useful for BCI applications. EEG and speech processing methods are explored, as are the technological basics of how to operate and record EEGs. Finally, the authors include information on EEG-based emotion recognition, classification, and a proposed EEG/speech fusion method for how to most accurately detect emotional states in EEG recordings. Provides detailed insight on the science of emotion and the brain signals underlying this phenomenon; Examines emotions as a multimodal entity, utilizing a bimodal emotion recognition system of EEG and speech data; Details the implementation of techniques used for acquiring as well as analyzing EEG and speech signals for emotion recognition. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A number of extensions to the basic model that are applicable to the civil aviation environment are outlined, based on the analysis of eight studies involving sleep diaries gathered from pilots undertaking a range of duty schedules. The relationship between subjective alertness and performance of laboratory tasks is described and it is concluded that different tasks are affected differentially by fatigue. In general, there is a larger impact on the incidence of errors than on response time. The implementation of the full model in the Integrated Performance Modeling Environment is described and the application of both the alertness and performance models to two scenarios provided by the workshop organizers is outlined. It is concluded that further work is needed in three areas: cumulative fatigue, the impact of sleep architecture, and the prediction of performance for complex tasks in systems. © by Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.},

  abstract                = {Operator fatigue and time-of-day induced variations in cognitive effectiveness can lead to lapses in attention, slowed reactions, and impaired reasoning and decision-making that has been shown to contribute to accidents, incidents and errors in a host of industrial and military settings. During the past three years, the US Air Force has sponsored the development of a model of human fatigue and circadian variation and a scheduling tool based upon the model that will be used to minimize aircrew fatigue. The initial test version of the tool has passed review by the operational wings of the AF and a final operational product is in advanced development and validation. The software was developed by SAIC and NTI and is called the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST™). This fatigue forecasting system is being developed and tested by NTI under a small business innovative research (SBIR) grant from the US Air Force, now in the third year of a three-year program. Fatigue predictions are derived from the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE™) model invented by Dr. Steven Hursh of SAIC. The patented SAFTE™ model has received a broad scientific review and the DoD considers it the most complete, accurate, and operationally practical model currently available to aid operator scheduling. The Department of Transportation is in the second phase of a three-phase project to validate and calibrate the model for avoiding excessive fatigue in transportation operations. The FAST scheduling tool uses the model to compare schedules in terms of predicted performance effectiveness. FAST allows easy entry of proposed schedules and generates graphical predictions of performance along with tables of estimated effectiveness scores for objective comparison. Optimal schedules may be selected based on average effectiveness for proposed work periods or mission critical events. The tool may also be used for retrospective analysis of fatigue related factors that may have contributed to an accident, error or safety related incident. In this mode, information on the work and sleep schedules of operators prior to the event may be entered into the tool and a projection of performance effectiveness at the time of the event is determined. In combination with other information, this analysis can project the combined effects of time of day and sleep history as a contributing factor to safety related events.

  abstract                = {Many advances have been made to shipping and the maritime industry over the last century. Despite these advances, errors that lead to injuries, accidents, and catastrophes continue to occur. Fatigue has been identified as a major contributor to these incidents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of fatigue for mariners and, specifically, for deck watch officers (DWOs). A review of the literature was completed to identify factors that might impact the prevalence of fatigue in the maritime industry. Questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were used to collect data to evaluate the relationship among sleep, the mariner's work environment, and fatigue. It was found that advances in technology have reduced the number of personnel on the bridge and, subsequently, increased the workload for DWOs. With the multitude of DWO duties and responsibilities, current staffing levels are not always adequate for ensuring proper rest. While regulations that address hours of rest for mariners appear to be adequate, current regulations do not adequately address the challenges of dynamic schedules and human physiology. © Marine Technology.},

  abstract                = {A questionnaire study was conducted to obtain information from shiftworkers on the levels of tiredness experienced on the drive to and from work at different times of the day. The results demonstrated that, compared to non-shiftworkers, shiftworkers were more tired on the drive between their home and the workplace and more at risk of falling asleep behind the wheel. The main factors contributing to this increased level of sleepiness and associated driving impairment were the length of the sleep period prior to work, the type of shift and the travelling time. There was some evidence to suggest that on working days shiftworkers were more likely to be involved in an accident than non-shiftworkers. However, there were insufficient data to determine whether accidents were correlated with driver sleepiness.},

  abstract                = {Aimed at the problem of detection inaccuracy for drowsy driving due to neglect of individual difference in current detection methods, a drowsy driving detection model considering individual difference was built to accommodate the difference of drivers in driving behavior and physiological feature. The drowsy driving simulation experiment was carried out for participants after having worked for 8 hours in night shift by driving simulator with high fidelity. Data of each driver were collected and 19 driving behavior indicators and 4 eye movement indicators were extracted. In the experiment process, subjective enquiry method was adopted to obtain the information about drowsiness degree of driver. On this basis, a multilevel ordered Logit (MOL) model considering individual difference, an ordered Logit (OL) model without considering individual difference and an artificial neural network (ANN) model were established to evaluate drowsiness degree. The results show that among 23 variables, four variables including percentage of eyelid closure time, average pupil diameter, standard deviation of lane departure and reversal rate of steering wheel are most important. MOL model has the highest drowsiness detection accuracy, which indicates that consideration of individual differences helps to improve the detection accuracy for drowsiness. © 2016, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

  abstract                = {BACKGROUND: Morningness and eveningness preference (chronotype), an endogenous component of the circadian clock could play a key role in a worker's ability for adjusting to shift work. Morning types are those individuals who prefer going to bed and waking up early, whereas Evening types tend to sleep at later hours and find it difficult to get up in the morning. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to survey, the relationship between morningness-eveningness type, sleep quality and insomnia in shift worker nurses. PARTICIPANTS: The participants comprised 160 nurses working in three different wards in two university hospitals in Iran. METHODS: Nurses completed the Horne and Ostberg [23] questionnaire to assess the distribution of morningness or eveningness preference, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index [22] and Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire [21] to measure self reported sleep quality and insomnia. Demographic information was also collected in order to explore the relationship between circadian rhythms, sleep quality and prevalence of insomnia in shift workers. RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of poor sleep quality was high. More than half of the participants had poor sleep. Evening type nurses had worse sleep quality in our study (P < 0.05). There is not any significant association between the shift type and age of the nurses with their quality of sleep (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that nurses who had a morning sleep preference had better sleep quality. A survey of chronotype of nurses could be useful, so that individuals may be assigned to different shifts according to their sleep preference. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.},

  abstract      = {ABSTRACT The present study sought to objectively describe the spontaneous sleep/wakefulness pattern of shift workers during a 24‐hour period. Portable Medilog tape‐recorders were used for ambulatory EEG monitoring of 25 male papermill workders (25–55 years) during days with night and afternoon work. The rusults showed that sleep after night work was two hours shorter than after afternoon worl. The sleep reduction affected mainly Stage 2 and REM sleep while slow wave sleep was unchanged. In connection with night work 28\% of the workders took a nap in the afternoon. These naps contained a large proportion of slow wave sleep and were, apparently, caused by the sleep deficit after the short main sleep period. The EEG recordings also revealed that 20\% of the participants had sleep episodes during night work. These naps were as long as the afternoon naps, were experienced as “dozing off” ragher than naps. Occurred at the time of the though of the circadian wakefulness rhythm, and were concomitant with extreme subjective sleepiness and low rated work load. It was concluded that not only the sleep of shift workders was disturbed, but also the wakefulness‐ to the extent that sleepiness during night work sometimes reached a level where reasonable wakefulness could not be maintained. The latter observation is probably of special importance in work situations demanding a great responsiility of human lives or for great economic values.},

We first, review different types of measures used in sleepiness detection systems (SDSs) and presents their advantages and drawbacks. Second, the review includes several techniques proposed in ESDSs to optimize the number of EEG electrodes, increasing the sleepiness level resolution and incorporation of circadian information.

Data was analyzed using Bayesian multilevel modeling. Unintentional LDs increased during night driving, as did KSS and long blink durations(LBD). Lateral position moved to the left LDs were predicted by self-reported sleepiness and LBDs across time and were significantly higher in individuals with high sleepiness. Removal of intentional LDs, enhanced the KSS/LD relation. It was concluded that LDs, KSS, and LBDs are strongly increased during night driving and that KSS predicts LDs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract                = {Driver drowsiness is a major cause of mortality in traffic accidents worldwide. Many physiological signals have been proposed to detect driver drowsiness. Among these signals, an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, which reflects the brain activities, is more directly related to drowsiness. Thus, many EEG-based driver drowsiness detection (DDD) models gained more and more attention in recent years. However, one limitation of these studies is that these models merely estimate discrete labels and, thus, did not allow for estimating the relative severity of driver drowsiness. This paper proposes a support vector machine-based posterior probabilistic model (SVMPPM) for DDD, aimed at transforming the drowsiness level to any value of 0∼1 instead of discrete labels. A fully wearable EEG system which consists of a Bluetooth-enabled EEG headband and a commercial smartwatch was used to evaluate the proposed model in a real-time way. Twenty subjects who participated in a 1-h monotonous driving simulation experiment were used to develop this model with fifteen subjects for a building model and five subjects for a testing model. According to a video-based reference, the proposed system obtained an accuracy of 91.25% for an alert group (73 out of 80 data sets), 83.78% for an early-warning group (93 out of 111 data sets), and 91.92% for a full-warning group (91 out of 99 data sets). These results indicate that the combination of the proposed SVMPPM, the EEG headband, and the wrist-worn smart device constitutes an effective, simple, and inexpensive wearable solution for DDD. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Current methods for the assessment of physiological sleepiness levels, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) have several limitations and are particularly impractical in field or occupational studies. In this study, the effectiveness of the Alpha Attenuation Test (AAT) for the quantification of sleepiness has been evaluated and compared to the MSLT during a 40-h sleep deprivation protocol. The AAT, a 12-min eye closed/open protocol, is a quantitative method based on the fact that EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity tends to increase with eyes open as individuals get sleepier, while it decreases with eyes closed. In this validation study, the AAT proved to be a sensitive measure of sleepiness induced by sleep deprivation, and it also correlated well with the MSLT. Relative to the MSLT, the AAT has the advantages of being objective, minimally intrusive, and more practical especially in industrial or field studies. },

  abstract                = {Shorter, more frequent rosters, such as 6h-on/6h-off split shifts, may offer promise to sleep, subjective sleepiness and performance by limiting shift length and by offering opportunities for all workers to obtain some sleep across the biological night. However, there exists a paucity of studies that have examined these shifts using objective measures of sleep and performance. The present study examined neurobehavioural performance, sleepiness and sleep during 6h-on/6h-off split sleep schedules. Sixteen healthy adults (males, 26.13y ± 4.46) participated in a 9-day laboratory study that included two baseline nights (BL, 10h time in bed (TIB), 2200h-0800h), 4 days on one of two types of 6h-on/6h-off split sleep schedules with 5h TIB during each 'off' period (6h early: TIB 0300h-0800h and 1500h-20000h, or 6-late: TIB 0900h-1400h and 2100h-0200h), and two recovery nights (10h TIB per night, 2200h-0800h). Participants received 10h TIB per 24h in total across both shift schedules. A neurobehavioural test bout was completed every 2 h during wake, which included the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of day (BL, shift days 1-4), schedule (6h early, 6h late) and trial (numbers 1-6) on PVT lapses (operationalised as the number of reaction times >500 ms), PVT total lapse time, PVT fastest 10% of reaction times and KSS. Analyses were also conducted examining the effect of day and schedule on sleep variables. Overall, PVT lapses and total lapse time did not differ significantly between baseline and shift days, however, peak response speeds were significantly slower on the first shift day when compared to baseline, but only for those in the 6h-late condition. Circadian variations were apparent in performance outcomes, with individuals in the 6h-late condition demonstrated significantly more and longer lapses and slower peak reaction times at the end of their night shift (0730h) than at any other time during their shifts. In the 6h-early condition, only response speed significantly differed across trials, with slower response speeds occurring at trial 1 (0930h) than in trials 3 (1330h) or 4 (2130h). While subjective sleepiness was higher on shift days than at baseline, sleepiness did not accumulate across days. Total sleep was reduced across split sleep schedules compared to baseline. Overall, these results show that while there was not a cumulative cost to performance across days of splitting sleep, participants obtained less sleep and reported lowered alertness on shift days. Tests near the circadian nadir showed higher sleepiness and increased performance deficits. While this schedule did not produce cumulative impairment, the performance deficits witnessed during the biological night are still of operational concern for industry and workers alike. © 2015.},

  abstract                = {Sleep inertia is a safety concern for shift workers returning to work soon after waking up. Split duty schedules offer an alternative to longer shift periods, but introduce additional wake-ups and may therefore increase risk of sleep inertia. This study investigated sleep inertia across a split duty schedule. Sixteen participants (age range 21–36 years; 10 females) participated in a 9-day laboratory study with two baseline nights (10 h time in bed, [TIB]), four 24-h periods of a 6-h on/6-h off split duty schedule (5-h TIB in off period; 10-h TIB per 24 h) and two recovery nights. Two complementary rosters were evaluated, with the timing of sleep and wake alternating between the two rosters (2 am/2 pm wake-up roster versus 8 am/8 pm wake-up roster). At 2, 17, 32 and 47 min after scheduled awakening, participants completed an 8-min inertia test bout, which included a 3-min psychomotor vigilance test (PVT-B), a 3-min Digit-Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and the Samn–Perelli Fatigue Scale (SP-Fatigue). Further testing occurred every 2 h during scheduled wakefulness. Performance was consistently degraded and subjective sleepiness/fatigue was consistently increased during the inertia testing period as compared to other testing times. Morning wake-ups (2 am and 8 am) were associated with higher levels of sleep inertia than later wake-ups (2 pm and 8 pm). These results suggest that split duty workers should recognise the potential for sleep inertia after waking, especially during the morning hours. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

Existing vision-based systems are usually restricted to using visual cues, depend on tedious parameter tuning, or cannot work under general conditions. One additional crucial issue is the lack of public datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of different methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical temporal Deep Belief Network (HTDBN) method for drowsy detection. Our scheme first extracts high-level facial and head feature representations and then use them to recognize drowsiness-related symptoms. Two continuous-hidden Markov models are constructed on top of the DBNs. These are used to model and capture the interactive relations between eyes, mouth and head motions. We also collect a large comprehensive dataset containing various ethnicities, genders, lighting conditions and driving scenarios in pursuit of wide variations of driver videos. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed HTDBN framework in detecting drowsiness based on different visual cues. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

  abstract      = {Bio-mathematical models that predict fatigue and/or sleepiness have proved a useful adjunct in the management of what has been typically referred to as fatigue-related risk. Codifying what constitutes appropriate use of these models will be increasingly important over the next decade. Current guidelines for determining a safe working time arrangement based on model outputs generally use a single upper threshold and are, arguably, over-simplistic. These guidelines fail to incorporate explicitly essential aspects of the risk assessment process – namely, the inherent uncertainty and variability in human sleep–wake behavior; the non-linear relationship between fatigue, task performance and safety outcomes; the consequence of a fatigue-related error and its influence on overall risk; and the impact of risk mitigation or controls in reducing the likelihood or consequence of a fatigue-related error. As industry and regulatory bodies increasingly move toward performance-based approaches to safety management, any fatigue risk management system that includes a bio-mathematical model should specify what exactly is measured by the model, and how the model can be used in the context of a safety management system approach. This will require significant dialog between the various parties with an interest in bio-mathematical models, i.e. developers, vendors, end-users, and regulators.},

  abstract                = {Datasets having a highly imbalanced class distribution present a fundamental challenge in machine learning, not only for training a classifier, but also for evaluation. There are also several different evaluation measures used in the class imbalance literature, each with its own bias. Compounded with this, there are different cross-validation strategies. However, the behavior of different evaluation measures and their relative sensitivities-not only to the classifier but also to the sample size and the chosen cross-validation method-is not well understood. Papers generally choose one evaluation measure and show the dominance of one method over another. We posit that this common methodology is myopic, especially for imbalanced data. Another fundamental issue that is not sufficiently considered is the sensitivity of classifiers both to class imbalance as well as to having only a small number of samples of the minority class. We consider such questions in this paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

  abstract                = {With a plethora of available classification performance measures, choosing the right metric for the right task requires careful thought. To make this decision in an informed manner, one should study and compare general properties of candidate measures. However, analysing measures with respect to complete ranges of their domain values is a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we attempt to support such analyses with a specialized visualisation technique, which operates in a barycentric coordinate system using a 3D tetrahedron. Additionally, we adapt this technique to the context of imbalanced data and put forward a set of measure properties, which should be taken into account when examining a classification performance measure. As a result, we compare 22 popular measures and show important differences in their behaviour. Moreover, for parametric measures such as the Fβ and IBAα(G-mean), we analytically derive parameter thresholds that pinpoint the changes in measure properties. Finally, we provide an online visualisation tool that can aid the analysis of measure variability throughout their entire domains. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Ship groundings are one of the more frequent types of accidents encountered, and this study examines the maritime accident reports issued for grounded ships between 1993 and 2011. These were sourced using the International Maritime Organization's Global Integrated Shipping Information System and the reports published by the countries and relevant institutions that investigated the accidents. The grounding accidents are analysed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and the objective of this study is to act as an advisory paper on the prevention of grounding accidents involving human error. The results suggest that the most significant causes of these types of accidents are, lack of communication and coordination in Bridge Resource Management, position-fixing application errors, lookout errors, interpretation errors, use of improper charts, inefficient use of bridge navigation equipment, and fatigue. It is suggested that providing more education and training opportunities to seafarers, promoting widespread use on board of Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems, and improving seafarers' working hours and rest breaks would help to reduce grounding accidents significantly.},

Fatigue is most strongly influenced by less than adequate (LTA) manning levels and variable working conditions. LTA manning and Variable working conditions are shown to have strong influence on human fatigue on board. The regression models also show that offcers working 12-12 shifts have a significantly higher probability of having variable work hours which in turn have a negative impact on their fatigue levels. © SEECMAR.

  abstract                = {Falling asleep while driving accounts for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents under monotonous driving conditions. Many of these accidents are related to work - for example, drivers of lorries, goods vehicles, and company cars. Time of day (circadian) effects are profound, with sleepiness being particularly evident during night shift work, and driving home afterwards. Circadian factors are as important in determining driver sleepiness as is the duration of the drive, but only duration of the drive is built into legislation protecting professional drivers. Older drivers are also vulnerable to sleepiness in the mid-afternoon. Possible pathological causes of driver sleepiness are discussed, but there is little evidence that this factor contributes greatly to the accident statistics. Sleep does not occur spontaneously without warning. Drivers falling asleep are unlikely to recollect having done so, but will be aware of the precursory state of increasing sleepiness; probably reaching a state of fighting off sleep before an accident. Self awareness of sleepiness is a better method for alerting the driver than automatic sleepiness detectors in the vehicle. None of these have been proved to be reliable and most have shortcomings. Putative counter measures to sleepiness, adopted during continued driving (cold air, use of car radio) are only effective for a short time. The only safe counter measure to driver sleepiness, particularly when the driver reaches the stage of fighting sleep, is to stop driving, and - for example, take a 30 minute break encompassing a short (< 15 minute) nap or coffee (about 150 mg caffeine), which are very effective particularly if taken together. Exercise is of little use. Conclusions - More education of employers and employees is needed about planning journeys, the dangers of driving while sleepy, and driving at vulnerable times of the day.},

  abstract = {Background: The consequences of fatigue for the health and safety of seafarers has caused concern in the industry and among academics, and indicates the importance of further research into risk factors and preventive interventions at sea. This review gives an overview of the key issues relating to seafarer fatigue.Materials and methods: A literature study was conducted aiming to collect publications that address risk factors for fatigue, short-term and long-term consequences for health and safety, and options for fatigue mitigation at sea. Due to the limited number of publications that deals with seafarers, experiences from other populations sharing the same exposures (e.g. shift work) were also included when appropriate.Results: Work at sea involves multiple risk factors for fatigue, which in addition to acute effects (e.g., impaired cognition, accidents) contributes through autonomic, immunologic and metabolic pathways to the development of chronic diseases that are particularly prevalent in seafarers.Conclusions: Taking into account the frequency of seafarer fatigue and the severity of its consequences, one should look into the efficacy of the current legislative framework and the industry’s compliance, the manning of the international merchant fleet, and optimised working, living and sleeping conditions at sea. Considering circumstances at sea, e.g. working in shifts and crossing time zones, that cannot be altered, further assessment of the potentials of preventive interventions including fatigue prediction tools and individual fatigue mitigation management systems is recommended.  },

  abstract = {Membership function is a curve that shows mapping the input data points into the value or degree of membership which has an interval between 0 and 1. One way to get membership value is through a function approach. There are some membership functions can be used on mamdani fuzzy inference system. They are triangular, trapezoid, singleton, sigmoid, Gaussian, etc. In this paper only discuss three membership functions, are triangular, trapezoid and Gaussian. These three membership functions will be compared to see the difference in parameter values and results obtained. For case study in this paper is admission of students at popular school. There are three variable can be used, they are students’ report, IQ score and parents’ income. Which will then be created if-then rules.},

Data collected over a 10-30-d period from 141 subjects aboard eight ships included information concerning work-rest schedules, sleep timing, alertness on the job and critical fatigue. The data indicate that watchstanders on the 4-on, 8-off schedule show considerable disruption in their sleep. The average sleep duration for all mariners is 6.6 h; watchstanders obtain their sleep in fragmented periods that are frequently less than 5 h in duration. Analysis of critical fatigue shows an incidence of 1-24% across personnel and measures. Of particular concern are the watchstanders on the 04.00-08.00 schedule, who sleep less than 4 h per 24-h period 22% of the time. Potential countermeasures, including changes in scheduling and staffing are proposed.},

Four cues which characterises fatigue are used to determine the fatigue level. We used Support Vector Machines to estimate the percentage eye closure, which is the strongest cue. Improved results were achieved by using Support Vector Machines in comparison to Naive Bayes classifier. The performance was further improved by fusing all four cues using fuzzy rules.},

  abstract                = {Study Objectives: To assess whether changes in psychomotor vigilance during sleep deprivation can be estimated using heart rate variability (HRV). Design: HRV, ocular, and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures were compared for their ability to predict lapses on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Setting: Chronobiology and Sleep Laboratory, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore. Participants: Twenty-four healthy Chinese men (mean age ± SD = 25.9 ± 2.8 years). Interventions: Subjects were kept awake continuously for 40 hours under constant environmental conditions. Every 2 hours, subjects completed a 10-minute PVT to assess their ability to sustain visual attention. Measurements and Results: During each PVT, we examined the electrocardiogram (ECG), EEG, and percentage of time that the eyes were closed (PERCLOS). Similar to EEG power density and PERCLOS measures, the time course of ECG RR-interval power density in the 0.02- 0.08- Hz range correlated with the 40-hour profile of PVT lapses. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, RR-interval power density performed as well as EEG power density at identifying a sleepiness-related increase in PVT lapses above threshold. RR-interval power density (0.02-0.08 Hz) also classified subject performance with sensitivity and specificity similar to that of PERCLOS. Conclusions: The ECG carries information about a person's vigilance state. Hence, HRV measures could potentially be used to predict when an individual is at increased risk of attentional failure. Our results suggest that HRV monitoring, either alone or in combination with other physiologic measures, could be incorporated into safety devices to warn drowsy operators when their performance is impaired.},

  abstract                = {Study Objectives: Although impairment of daytime functioning is a symptom of many sleep disorders, there are limited data on their nature for some patient groups. The role of the circadian system on impaired functioning, specifically the wake maintenance zone (WMZ) - a ∼3-h window of reduced sleep propensity that occurs shortly before the onset of melatonin synthesis - has received little attention. The study examined the influence of the WMZ on neurobehavioral performance under normal conditions and following sleep deprivation. Methods: Thirty-one adults (8 F; 18-29 y) completed an inpatient protocol including a baseline day (8-h sleep:16-h wake) and a ∼50-h constant routine (CR), including regular assessment of plasma melatonin and neurobehavioral performance (i.e., auditory and visual psychomotor vigilance tests [aPVT, vPVT], Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and subjective sleepiness). Results: Performance in the 3 hours before the onset of melatonin secretion (i.e., the expected WMZ) was significantly improved compared to performance during a 3-hour block earlier in the biological day, despite a longer time awake. The improvement during WMZ was most prominent after extended wakefulness (i.e., day 2 of the CR). Conclusions: These results suggest that alignment of circadian phase with respect to sleep-wake timing may affect cognitive performance, particularly when homeostatic sleep pressure is high, and especially when performance is assessed in the evening, near the predicted WMZ. The potential contribution of the WMZ to sleep-onset insomnia complaints should be assessed further, using objective neurobehavioral testing and simultaneous circadian phase measurement.},
